# Ex 1.2
Explain how a device which, upon input of one of two non-orthogonal quantum states correctly identified the state, violets the no-cloning
theorem (and vice versa).<br>
![Device](https://github.com/akropf/Images/blob/main/NC/NC1-2.png) <br>
A device which can identify an unknown state (e.g. identify the probability amplitudes) implies that we can now produce infinite copies of this state (e.g. clone), violating the no-cloning theorem.
Vice versa, if there was a cloning device, we could clone a unknown state infinitively often. Afterwards, we can measure each individual clone which would enable us to identify 
the unknown state.

## Note
It is specified that we have non-orthogonal quantum states, since there is a ["loophole" in the no-cloning theorem that allows cloning of known orthogonal states](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/21748/no-cloning-theorem-and-distinguishing-between-two-non-orthogonal-quantum-states?rq=1)
